## Overview

### The challenge

This application is a simple movie/tv show search site. Can filter your search term by movie, tv show or by popular releases.

## My process

### Built with

- Basic HTML/CSS/JS

### What I learned

In this project, I refreshed my skills on the fundamental javascript, css and api usage. It brought my mind and problem solving skills back to the basics, and surprisingly it was rather challenging to figure some bugs out.

### Continued development

I would definitely like to continue to add a modal, additional support for rating movies, adding movies, more advanced search, etc
